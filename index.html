    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <p>
        Among Us is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players (previously four to ten players), although
        recommended for at least five.[13] Up to three players are randomly[14] and secretly chosen to be the
        Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, a round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld";
        a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus";[15] or an airship based on Innersloth's
        Henry Stickmin series called "The Airship".
