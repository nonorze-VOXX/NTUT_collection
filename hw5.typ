==  worse case time complexity: $Theta(n^2)$
when all element place in the same bucket,\
 and the bucket is sorted by selection sort,\
  then the time complexity is $Theta(n^2)$\
== simple change make worst case time complexity to $O(n log(n))$
use merge sort to sort the bucket, \
then the worst-case time complexity is $O(n log(n))$

== algorithm
get length from 1 to n,\
get max price in each length by split each length into two parts and get the max price in each part,\
then get the max price in length n.\
```python
maxPriceInLength[n]
for i in 1 to len(rod):
  for j in 1 to i:
    maxPriceInLength[i] = max(maxPriceInLength[i], price[j] + maxPriceInLength[i-j]+cuttingCost)
return maxPriceInLength[n]
```
== time complexity
$O(n^2)$

```python
let dp[n][n] =[ -1 for every cell]
function lps(string s1, string s2, int n1, int n2):
  if n1==0 or n2==0:
    return 0
  if dp[n1][n2] != -1:
    return dp[n1][n2]
  if s1[n1-1] == s2[n2-1]:
    dp[n1][n2] = 1+lps(s1,s2,n1-1,n2-1)
  else:
    dp[n1][n2] = max(lps(s1,s2,n1-1,n2),lps(s1,s2,n1,n2-1))
  return dp[n1][n2]

input = input()
ans = lps(input, input[::-1], len(input), len(input))
```

== time complexity
$O(n)* O(n^2)=O(n^3)$

== algorithm
dp store when the max length is index, most min cost.
```python
dp[n]= []
dp[0] = 0
dp[1] = cost[1]

for i in 2 to n:
  dp[i] = inf
  for j in 0 to i:
    costJ = cost[i] + ((1+(i-j))*(i-j)/2) +dp[j]
    dp[i] = min(dp[i], costJ)

return dp[n]
```

== time complexity
$O(n^2)$
